# MNIST Training Data Sorting Experiment

## Overview
This project investigates the effect of sorting training data on neural network learning, interpretability, and performance using the MNIST dataset. By analyzing various data orderings, we aim to uncover patterns that influence model behavior and generalization.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-experiment.git
   cd mnist-experiment
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Preprocess Data
To sort or shuffle the MNIST dataset:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```
Output:
- Sorted datasets will be saved in `data/sorted/`.
- Randomized dataset will be saved in `data/random/`.

### 2. Train Models
To train models on sorted and shuffled datasets:
```bash
python src/train.py
```
Output:
- Model weights and logs will be saved in the `results/` directory.

### 3. Analyze Results
To generate and save analysis visualizations:
```bash
python src/analysis.py
```
Output:
- Activation heatmaps will be saved in `results/activations/`.
- Confidence image tables will be saved in `results/confidence_images/`.

### 4. Visualize Results
To create additional visualizations:
```bash
python src/visualize.py
```

---

## Results
All results, including trained model weights and visualizations, will be stored in the `results/` directory.
